# Before Death

## Your loved one may know answers to questions about practical matters that no one else knows. 
Family members may think they know, but they may not be right. So you need to capture some information. 

## Will or trust. 
Anyone with any significant property, such as a house or investments, should have a will or trust. Find a good lawyer to help you. (Fees for a simple estate plan are usually about $5,000, and many lawyers will charge a minimum or fixed fee. Ask for referrals from friends and shop around.) Once you set up the trust, a crucial and common mistake is to fail to move assets into the trust. This needs to be done before death. All major assets -- real property, bank or investment accounts for example, should be transferred into the trust. Cars or personal property are probably not necessary to transfer. For valuable tangible property not in the trust, consider giving it away prior to your loved one’s death. Consider having your loved one sign the title for the car before they die so the chosen recipient can simply transfer the title without having to go through a complicated process. Consider giving away items of sentimental value before death, so your loved one knows they are going to the right person.

## Obituary. 
Consider writing it in advance or having your loved one review it or pick out a photo. Ask what your loved one wants to be remembered for. Decide who will write it and where it will appear.

## Donations. 
Ask if your loved one has a preference for a charity to receive memorial donations.

## Funeral arrangements and disposition of remains. 
If open-casket, select clothes for your loved one for the funeral. Also make sure there are funds for whatever you plan.

## Digital Accounts. 
Identify all online accounts and passwords, including banking, social media, subscriptions, cryptocurrency wallets, so they can be shut down after death. It is crucial to get control of your loved one’s primary email account so you can shut down activity. Get PIN information for computers, phones, or tablets.

## Smartphone. 
Having your loved one’s main smartphone is very helpful to shut down online accounts, because many cancellations will require 2 factor authentication via text.

## Primary email. 
Make sure you can access your loved one’s primary email account.

## Information. Make sure you know your loved one’s: 
- birthdate and place of birth
- Social Security Number
- Veteran Status. For information on veteran death benefits, go here: https://www.usa.gov/veteran-burial-benefits 

## Locate Documents. 
Find any documents, paper or electronic, such as will and trust documents, life insurance policies, or business records. Be sure beneficiaries are correct on life insurance. Also locate personal papers, such as letters, birth certificate, marriage certificate, passport, driver’s license or other IDs, armed service discharge papers, which you may want to keep or give to family members. 

## Medical POA 
(AARP is a good source for state-specific forms at https://www.aarp.org/caregiving/financial-legal/free-printable-advance-directives/). Even if your loved one already has a POA, a recent one, taking into account your loved one’s immediate medical condition, is helpful to avoid misunderstandings. Detailed instructions are best.

## Personal possessions. 
Ask what your loved one wants done with personal possessions such as furniture, cookery, or clothes.

## Unfinished Business. 
Ask whether your loved one has any unfinished personal business.  Anyone to tell goodbye?  Apologize or express love? Last wishes?

## Notifications. 
Prepare a list of friends, family and colleagues to notify. Remember religious communities, hobby organizations, and civic organizations.

##Say Goodbye. Tell your loved one what you need to say, earlier rather than later.

# After Death: 
An important objective of this process is to avoid fraud and minimize expenses.

## Note the time and date of death. 
You will need this information later. 

## Call the funeral home. 
They will remove the body and store it for burial or cremation. If you want to sit with your loved one for a while, do that first. They will need you to authorize burial or cremation. That is usually done a few days to a week after death.

## Notify friends and family of the death. T
ell them your preferences for condolences to the family, flowers, and about charitable donations or memorial services.

## Notify service providers
...such as haircutters, gardeners, housekeepers, or health workers, whose services are no longer necessary.

## Get the death certificate. 
This may come from a funeral home or a doctor. If you are required to provide one to prove death, provide a copy; keep the original.

## Notify life insurance carriers of the death. 
They will want a copy of the death certificate.

## Notify Social Security Administration (SSA). 
If your loved one has been receiving Social Security or Medicare benefits, notify them of the death to stop the benefits. Your funeral home may do this for you -- they are usually obligated to inform SSA of the death. If so, you can avoid a wait on the phone for SSA (which is sometimes lengthy). If SSA benefits are being automatically deposited into a bank account, they can be removed unilaterally by SSA if they were paid for periods after death.

## Obituary. 
Write the obituary and place it with your selected publication. Publications usually charge for them.

## Disposition of estate. I
f you are the executor of a trust, or simply the one in the family that manages practical or financial affairs, you will need to go through this process. It may involve probate before a court. Overall, it is the process of transferring the decedent’s assets to heirs or other recipients.

## Shut down online or other subscriptions. Cancel any recurring payments. You should check credit card statements to be sure you get them all, so this process may take a month or two. Most accounts can be closed without a death certificate. A few will require it.
Online subscriptions can be particularly time consuming to cancel. It’s easiest to cancel those via Apple or Android, if you have access to the primary cell phone. Be sure to check newspaper subscriptions, auto club, car insurance, club memberships.
Go through credit card statements to find all recurring charges. Cancel credit cards when you are done. Review all charges after your loved one’s death date to challenge fraudulent transactions.
Miscellaneous e-commerce accounts probably need not be canceled once their associated credit card is canceled.

## Cancel recurring medical prescriptions.

## Cancel credit cards and debit cards, once all pending charges come through and are paid.

## Factory reset computers, cell phones and tablets
(after getting any necessary information off of them)

## Dispose of medications.  
Most drug stores have places to lawfully dispose of controlled substances. Take particular care with narcotics. Dispose of them quickly, as they are often stolen.

## Check for safes or hiding places in the loved one’s living space.

## If your loved one has social media accounts, make an announcement and close the account.
Consider whether to annouce the death on that account, which may be easier if your loved one had lots of contacts on the platform. Otherwise you can post an announcement yourself and tag your loved one's account.

## If your loved one owns medical equipment (wheelchair, hospital bed, etc.) consider donating them to charity or giving them to another in need. 
If the equipment is rented, cancel the contract and return the equipment.
If necessary, engage a hauler to take away unwanted personal possessions, for donation or disposal.

## File final tax return.


# The physical process of dying. 
Here are some things it may help you to know, if you are present at a deathbed.

## Hospice. 
A hospice is a place where a dying person receives palliative care in anticipation of death. However, “hospice” sometimes refers also to a care coordinator that provides “comfort” (basically pain killers) or support for a home death. The decision to engage hospice services is a very important one. Talk to your loved one about initiating the process, and be sure the decision is voluntary and sensible.

## Quick decline. 
Once a loved one goes on hospice care, or stops taking medical care, their decline can be very quick. Hospice care often involves morphine, which will make communication difficult or impossible. Be sure to say goodbyes before starting this process. A quick decline can be shocking but it is usually a blessing.

## Shutdown. 
A person nearing death will stop producing much urine or feces. Urine becomes very dark, this is a sign kidneys are shutting down. If death is imminent, your loved one does not need food. Water or fluids (or wetting the lips) may be helpful to avoid suffering.
The “death rattle” usually signals death within the next 24 hours. Is not as scary as it sounds. It almost sounds like wet snoring, during both inhalation and exhalation. It is caused by mucus building up in the throat as the person’s body loses the strength to swallow and dispose of it. It is not painful.
It may be confusing and difficult to tell that your loved one has actually died. Lack of breathing is the most obvious sign. Listen at the chest for breath or use a mirror at the mouth. Lack of pulse at the jugular signals death as well, but unless you are accustomed to taking a pulse, you may not be confident that you can find a weak one. Consider trying to take one before death, so you can tell the difference when the time comes. Eventually the body will become cold, but that can take a while depending on the environment. If you have access to medical personnel, they can make a determination.

## Take care of yourself! 
What you have experienced is a normal part of life, but you may not be prepared for it.

## Your loved one does not need you anymore. 
It can be hard to let go of your feelings of responsibility. This is normal.

## You need to eat nutritious food, drink water, and sleep. 
A mild sleeping pill can provide temporary help. Your suffering will not help you or anyone else.

## Grief is natural. 
It affects everyone differently. Don’t feel guilty if your way of coping is different from what is “normal.” There is no normal. 

## Receiving sympathy. 
Your friends, family and colleagues will want to express their sympathy. Accept it gracefully. Don’t feel obligated to do any more to respond, unless you actually want to talk to them about your feelings.
Every time you have to tell someone your loved one has died, your grief will probably resurface. This will get better over time and the news spreads. 

## You may experience PTSD (nightmares, anxiety, flashbacks) after attending the death of a loved one. 
When you are attending a death, do not feel obligated to see or hear things that will disturb you, unless they are truly necessary. There are plenty of resources online about how to address PTSD.
